## Welcome

Hi, I’m Cameron.

I work in cybersecurity, mostly in Incident Response and SOC work.  
This site is where I keep notes, projects, and thoughts as I learn things.

It’s not meant to be polished. It’s here so I can keep track of what I’m working on and what I’ve already learned.

## Security, Cloud, and Automation

My day job lives in IR. Alerts, investigations, false positives, automation, tooling and the occasional real incident.

Lately I’ve been spending more time on:

- Cloud security in AWS and Azure
- SOAR and security automation
- Figuring out how AI fits into security work without treating it like magic

This site is part of my ongoing upskilling. I use it to document what I’m learning as I go, especially the parts that don’t immediately click.

If you’re an employer reading this, the way I write here is pretty close to how I think on the job.

## Projects

Anything I build that feels useful ends up here.

That includes:

- SOAR playbooks
- Detection or triage experiments
- Small scripts or tools
- Write-ups explaining why something exists, not just what it does

Some projects are clean. Some are rough. That’s intentional.

## TTRPG Stuff

I also spend a lot of time on tabletop RPGs.

This is where I keep:

- Characters and backstories
- Campaign notes
- Rules experiments and homebrew ideas

It’s creative space and a good break from security work.

## Life Notes

I’m also a partner, a parent, and trying to keep everything balanced.

You’ll occasionally see posts about:

- Working on call while raising a toddler
- Learning in small, realistic chunks
- Trying to build a career without burning everything else down

If you’re just browsing, feel free to look around.  
If you’re here for work reasons, the Projects section is probably the most relevant.

This site is a work in progress, and so am I.
