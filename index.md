## Welcome

I’m Cameron — a cybersecurity engineer working in Incident Response at a children’s hospital, and this site is where I **learn out loud**.

Here you’ll find:

- My **Cybersecurity Upskill Journey** into cloud and AI-assisted defense  
- **Projects** I’m building or shipping  
- **Opinions** on where security is headed  
- And a healthy amount of **TTRPG chaos** — characters, backstories, and campaign notes

## Cybersecurity & Cloud Security

I’ve spent the last several years on the front lines of SOC and Incident Response — dealing with real-world alerts that hit real people and real systems.

Now I’m expanding deeper into:

- **Cloud security** (Azure / AWS)
- **Security automation** (SOAR, scripted workflows)
- **AI-augmented detection & response**

I’m using this space to document what I’m learning, what’s working, and where I still feel like a beginner.

##  TTRPG & Storytelling

When I’m not thinking about attacker TTPs, I’m thinking about goblins, gods, and weird frontier worlds.

I use this site to:

- Share **characters and backstories**
- Track **campaign lore** and world-building
- Keep long-running **West Marches-style** ideas organized

## Life, Family & Everything Else

I’m a partner, parent, and pet wrangler on top of being a security engineer.

You’ll also see posts about:

- Balancing **IR shifts** with **toddler bedtimes**
- Trying to live more intentionally with tech
- Occasional life experiments & reflections

Thanks for visiting — feel free to explore the sections in the sidebar, and follow along as I try to stay one step ahead of attackers *and* laundry.
