## Hi, I’m Cameron — Cybersecurity Pro & Lifelong Learner

I’m a **Tier-2/3 Cybersecurity Engineer** working in **Incident Response** for a children’s hospital.  
For the past **7+ years**, I’ve focused on protecting critical infrastructure from constantly evolving threats — and I’m obsessed with learning what comes next.

### What I Do

- IR investigation and threat containment  
- Malware analysis & adversary behavior research  
- SOC automation using SOAR & SIEM (Splunk)  
- Vulnerability and risk remediation  
- Endpoint and identity security hardening  

At the end of the day, my purpose is to **protect people who depend on us**, especially in clinical environments where security can save lives.

### Where I’m Going

AI is transforming the security landscape — fast.  
So I’m expanding into:

- **Cloud Security** (Azure / AWS)
- **AI/ML-assisted defense**
- Threat-based automated response and detection
- Advanced Splunk development

Anything that ensures defenders stay *ahead* of attackers.

### What You'll Find Here

This blog is my **learning out loud** space — documenting:

- My Cloud & AI security **upskilling journey**
- Hands-on security **projects**
- **Cert experiences** (good, bad, painful)
- **Opinions** on our industry’s future
- **TTRPG worlds** I build with friends (because we all need hobbies 🤓)

If you're on a similar journey, I hope you’ll find useful insights — or at least a laugh.

### Outside the SOC

- Proud husband & dad
- Vegan-ish experimental cook
- TTRPG designer + forever GM
- Dog wrangler 🐶🐶
