## Backstory: A Problem That Keeps Solving Itself

Boomgrave was born in a perfectly ordinary village that should not—by any reasonable arcane measurement—have exploded.

It did anyway.

Some say it was a ley-line hiccup. Others blame a hedge wizard, a cursed idol, or an improperly buried wizard three generations back. Boomgrave doesn’t remember the cause. He remembers the **result**: screaming colors in the air, gravity briefly giving up, and young Boomgrave being thrown through a chicken coop and landing completely unharmed.

That was the first sign.

Instead of growing afraid of magic, Boomgrave grew *annoyed* by it. Weird things happened around him constantly. Fires burned the wrong color. Objects teleported when struck. Once, during a bar fight, Boomgrave punched a man and accidentally summoned flowers. Poisonous flowers.

As he got older, he discovered the pattern:  
When Boomgrave got **angry**, the world panicked.

Reality flinched. Space folded. Magic leaked out like a badly corked bottle. Sometimes it helped him. Sometimes it helped *someone else* and made things worse. Either way, Boomgrave learned to lean into it. If the universe wanted to misbehave, he’d give it a reason.

He left home after being politely but firmly asked never to rage within town limits again.

## A Professional Menace

Boomgrave discovered that adventuring guilds have an impressive tolerance for nonsense as long as it is:
1. Directed away from the guild hall  
2. Paid per job  
3. Someone else’s problem afterward  

He became a specialist in “unstable situations.” Magical ruins. Fey-touched forests. Cursed towers. Places where the laws of nature were more like **suggestions**. When spells backfired, Boomgrave thrived. When portals opened, he walked through them first. When magic lashed out, it often hit the wrong target.

Boomgrave is not cruel for cruelty’s sake—but he is **practical**. If intimidating someone avoids a fight, he does that. If smashing something solves the problem faster, he smashes it. If wild magic disintegrates a monster *and* the treasure chest, Boomgrave shrugs and asks for hazard pay.

He keeps contracts because reputation matters. He keeps allies alive because living allies complain less. He has no interest in ruling the world—just surviving it comfortably while it continues to misbehave around him.

## Personality & Roleplay Notes

- Treats magical disasters like mild inconveniences  
- Laughs when reality breaks, then hits it again  
- Keeps trophies from “impossible” fights  
- Will absolutely press the big red button if paid  

Boomgrave is jovial, unpredictable, and unsettlingly confident that things will “probably work out”—mostly because they usually do *for him*.
