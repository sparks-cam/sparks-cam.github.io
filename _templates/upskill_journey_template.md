#  Upskill Journey — <Topic / Week>

---

##  Context  
**Why this learning matters right now**

Explain *why* you chose this topic at this point in your journey.

Guiding questions:
- What gap are you trying to close?
- Was this driven by work, curiosity, or career pressure?
- Is this foundational knowledge or specialization?

Example:
> This week’s focus was on cloud identity fundamentals. As someone working incident response in a healthcare environment, I’ve noticed that more alerts intersect with cloud-native identity services. I want to understand these systems deeply rather than treat them as opaque black boxes.

---

##  What I Studied  
**Concrete topics and resources**

Keep this scannable. Bullet points work best.

- Topic or concept #1  
- Topic or concept #2  
- Tool, framework, or service explored  
- Any books, docs, or labs referenced  

Example:
- IAM vs directory-based identity systems  
- Conditional access vs network-based controls  
- Common cloud identity misconfigurations seen in breaches  

---

##  What I Built or Practiced  
**Hands-on application (even small counts)**

This is one of the most important sections for employers.

Examples:
- Built a small lab or proof of concept  
- Mapped concepts to real alerts or logs  
- Wrote pseudocode, diagrams, or detection logic  
- Practiced threat modeling or attack mapping  

If nothing was built, explain why and what you did instead.

---

##  What Was Challenging or Confusing  
**Honest friction points**

Showing struggle demonstrates real learning.

- What didn’t click at first?
- What assumptions had to be unlearned?
- Where did documentation or tools fall short?

Example:
> I initially struggled to stop thinking in terms of traditional network perimeters. Identity-first security models require a very different mental framework.

---

##  How This Changed My Thinking  
**Conceptual shifts**

Explain how this learning adjusted your mental model.

- Did it reframe how you see incidents?
- Did it change how you’d design detections?
- Did it clarify trade-offs you hadn’t noticed before?

---

##  How I’d Apply This in a Real Environment  
**Translate learning → business value**

Frame this as if explaining to a manager or teammate.

Examples:
- How would this improve detection quality?
- How would it reduce noise or response time?
- Where would this fit into IR or SOC workflows?

---

## What’s Next  
**Intentional forward momentum**

Outline the *next* step — not everything.

Examples:
- Deeper dive into a specific tool or service  
- Building a small project  
- Comparing two platforms  
- Mapping knowledge to MITRE ATT&CK  

---

##  Reflection (Optional)  
**The human element**

This section is optional but powerful.

Examples:
- Time constraints
- Work–life balance
- Motivation and pacing
- What “sustainable growth” looks like this week

---

##  Metadata Reference (Optional)

**Recommended categories**
- cybersecurity
- upskill-journey

**Common tags**
- incident-response
- cloud-security
- splunk
- soar
- detection-engineering
- learning-log
- career-growth

---

##  Summary

One or two sentences capturing the main takeaway from this learning period.

Example:
> This week reinforced that identity is often the primary control plane in modern environments, and understanding it deeply changes how I approach incident response.
