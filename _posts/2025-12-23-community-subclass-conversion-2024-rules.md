### Community Update 2014 Classes to 2024 Rules. 

## Why I Started Using This

With the 2024 rules landing, one of the things that immediately got messy was subclasses.

There’s a *lot* of great material still tied to the 2014 ruleset, and while most of it kind of works under 2024, the cracks show pretty quickly:
- subclass features landing at odd levels  
- wording that no longer lines up with new class design  
- abilities assuming older action economy or class structure  

I didn’t want to hand wave conversions every time, and I definitely didn’t want to rewrite subclasses from scratch. That’s where this document came in.

## The Document (And Giving Credit Where It’s Due)

This conversion work is **not mine**, and I want to be clear about that.

The 2014 → 2024 subclass update document was created by:

- **Spaghetti0 Homebrew**  
- **PerfectlyCircularSeal**

They’ve done the hard work of:
- lining 2014 subclasses up with the 2024 class frameworks  
- adjusting feature levels where needed  
- updating wording to match the newer rules language  
- keeping the original feel of each subclass intact  

Here’s the document:

👉 **2014 → 2024 Subclass Conversion Reference**  
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-8jLkYuOxQJIEyUHK4yAK8FBpwaSpgROjp7Tmb6hwg/edit

All credit belongs to the authors. This post is about how I *use* the document, not claiming ownership of it.

## How I Actually Use This at the Table

I treat this doc as a **compatibility reference**, not gospel.

### Updating Older Characters
When I’m converting a character built around a 2014 subclass:
- I keep the character concept exactly the same  
- I use the document to map features cleanly into 2024 progression  
- I only tweak things if something clearly breaks  

It’s been especially useful for long running campaigns and one shots where older characters are being dusted off.

### Rules Clarity (and Fewer Table Debates)
Instead of stopping play to argue:
> “Does this still work under the new rules?”

I can point to a shared reference and move on.

It doesn’t remove GM judgment, but it gives everyone a baseline, which keeps things friendly and fast.

## Why I Trust This Resource

What I like about this document is that it’s conservative in the best way.

It doesn’t try to:
- rebalance everything  
- juice subclasses with extra power  
- redesign features that already worked  

It focuses on:
- structural alignment  
- clean progression  
- updated wording  
- minimal disruption  

That makes it easy to slot into existing games without causing ripple effects.

## How This Fits Into My Rules Toolkit

I reference this document when:
- updating old characters  
- prepping mixed edition campaigns  
- writing character builds for the blog  
- sanity checking subclass progression  

It’s become one of those links I keep open during prep, right next to my notes.

## Closing Thoughts

Edition changes are inevitable. Losing good characters doesn’t have to be.

Huge credit again to **Spaghetti0 Homebrew** and **PerfectlyCircularSeal** for putting together something that makes the 2014 → 2024 transition smoother instead of stressful.

If you’re running older subclasses under the new rules, this is an easy win.
