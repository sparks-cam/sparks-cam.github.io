## D&D Sandbox Character — Wild Magic Sorcerer / Goblin

## Character – Campaign Introduction

One of the groups I play with has decided to start a new sandbox-style campaign. Like many long-running groups, life has made consistent scheduling difficult kids, jobs, shifting priorities so we’ve moved away from tightly scripted, narrative-heavy play toward a more flexible sandbox approach.

The group is in the middle of transitioning from the **2014 D&D 5e rules** to the **2024 rules**, but not everyone has access to the updated books yet. Because of that, I’ll be presenting this character with **two mechanical builds**: one using the 2014 rules and one using the 2024 rules. The character concept remains identical between both versions.

Sandbox campaigns are both freeing and challenging. Without extensive world lore at the beginning, characters need motivations that naturally push them toward exploration, danger, and cooperation. This character is designed with that flexibility in mind, allowing the DM to easily integrate elements of his past into the setting.

![Skrik - Goblin Wildmagic Sorcerer](https://github.com/sparks-cam/sparks-cam.github.io/releases/download/assets-v1/goblin_wild_magic.webp)

## Character Overview

**Name**: Skrik “Brightbang”  
**Race / Ancestry**: Goblin  
**Class / Subclass**: Sorcerer — Wild Magic  
**Alignment / Motivation**: Chaotic Neutral (impulsive, curious, self-preserving)  
**Pronouns**: He/Him  

I’ve always enjoyed the class fantasy of the Sorcerer as someone who doesn’t *learn* magic but instead survives it. Wild Magic Sorcerers in particular embody uncontrolled power—magic that reacts to emotion, stress, and instinct rather than careful planning.

Pairing that with a Goblin felt like a natural fit. Goblins already exist on the margins of society, often underestimated or treated as disposable. Giving one volatile arcane power creates a character who is unpredictable, dangerous, and constantly struggling to keep control of something that may eventually consume him.

Skrik does not believe he is special or chosen. He believes something went wrong—and now he has to live with it.

---

## Character Backstory

Skrik was born into a small scavenger-clan that lived beneath the ruins of an ancient arcane outpost. Most goblins avoided the deepest tunnels, where the stone glowed faintly and metal tools warped if left too long.

Skrik fell into those tunnels by accident.

He doesn’t remember the fall itself—only the light. A searing, impossible brightness that burned behind his eyes and filled his chest. When the clan eventually found him, he was alive, laughing, and crackling with energy.

Strange things began happening soon after. Fires sparked without flint. Objects drifted when Skrik panicked. Once, during an argument, a rival goblin was suddenly surrounded by harmless illusions of butterflies instead of the expected explosion.

The clan shaman declared Skrik *boom-touched* and demanded his exile. Keeping him meant risking the entire clan.

Since then, Skrik has survived by attaching himself to groups stronger and more capable than himself—mercenaries, explorers, and adventurers. He offers raw power, enthusiasm, and a willingness to do dangerous things first.

He keeps moving because he’s afraid that if he ever stops, whatever awakened inside him will finally catch up.

## Campaign Motivations

Skrik’s motivations fit cleanly into a sandbox campaign:

- **Gold means safety**
- **Power means control**
- **Knowledge means fewer accidents**

Adventuring provides all three.

He is drawn to ruins, magical anomalies, and unstable places not out of bravery, but familiarity. Whatever changed him came from places like these, and he hopes that understanding them might someday give him control—or at least answers.

---

## How He Gets Along in a Party

- Enthusiastically loyal to anyone who protects him
- Over-explains plans he only half understands
- Treats party members as friends, shields, and occasionally test subjects
- Feels genuine guilt when his magic harms allies

Despite the chaos, Skrik wants to belong somewhere.

---

## Roleplay Hooks

- Keeps a journal documenting every magical surge
- Believes his magic has a personality and sometimes argues with it
- Actively seeks items or spells that might stabilize his power
- Fears deep silence, glowing stone, and narrow tunnels

## Final Thoughts

Skrik is designed for low-lore, high-freedom campaigns. He works equally well as comic relief or as a tragic figure shaped by forces beyond his understanding.

Most importantly, he has a clear reason to adventure, a reason to stay with a party, and enough instability for the world to meaningfully react to his presence.
