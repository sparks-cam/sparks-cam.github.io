## D&D 2024 Sandbox Character— Wildfire Druid / Tiefling / 3


## Character - Campaign Introduction

One of the groups I'm in has recently decided to start a new campaign. The group has historically done D&D 5e and are looking to transition to the new 2024 Rules. Now the campaign previously for this group was a traditional Linear Story-focused campaign focusing on plot. Due to a number of life-changes(marriage, kids, jobs, school, you get the idea) for a lot of us our time is short for planning, scheduling, and playing. So in order to accommodate we've decided to switch to more Sandbox Campaign playstyle. The specifics of the campaign haven't really been determined. I'm unsure at the time of this post whether the campaign is more of a western marches style exploration, hex crawl, mega dungeon, or even survival but I do know it will be a Sandbox style gameplay without a ton of lore behind it at the beginning so I'm building this particular character in mind. 

Campaigns without a ton of world lore available in the beginning is both a positive and a negative. Positive aspect is I'm free to build my characters history, bonds and connections however I please and the DM can find useful ways to interact with it. The negative is that with the lack of connection to the world initially my character can end up wildly out of place in the setting, party, or world.
I'll be building this characters backstory with enough flexibility hopefully address the negative concerns. 

## 🪶 Character Overview

![Arkil - Tiefling Wildfire Druid](/assets/img/ttrpg/wildfire-tiefling/arkil_400.png)

**Name**: Arkil  
**Race/Ancestry**:  Tiefling (Infernal)  
**Class / Subclass (or Archetype)**:  Wildfire Druid  
**Level**:  3  
**Alignment / Motivation**:  Neutral Evil (pragmatic, vengeful, but cooperative if it serves his aims)  
**Pronouns**:  He/Him

I love the class fantasy of the Druid. A class that revolves around being a versatile, nature-attuned spellcaster who channels primal magic to heal, harm, and control the environment. I love the contrast of the class from Wizards(my other favorite class) who are primarily known for learning magic as an academic discipline and channel arcane magic instead of being conduits for natural or primal magic. 

With this class fantasy for the druid being in-tune with natural. It's pretty stereotypical of Druids to be considered good or at least neutral aligned characters who are primarily concerned with either protecting nature or at least maintaining the balance of the natural world. However I think another side of Druids that I rarely see explored in media and even in campaigns is the dark, cruel, predatory, and downright frightening aspect of nature being portrayed by Druids. So for this character I want to create a dark or evil-adjacent druid who can still reasonable fit into a party of your average adventurers. 

In my opinion no other Druid subclass fits as perfectly with this character theme than the Wildfire Druid. A druid who embraces both the destructive and restorative aspects of fire is perfect for a dark, vengeful, and ruthless druid. The Infernal Tiefling ancestry also fits this character concept and subclass so well despite it not being the most optimized ancestry for the druid.

## Character Backstory

Raised among a reclusive cabal of Tiefling nobles calling themselves the **Ashen Court**, they believed fire was purity made manifest a sacred force that burned away weakness. When the cabal’s mountain fortress was stormed by a coalition of fearful kingdoms, the young heir was left to burn with the rest. But the flames **did not consume them**… instead, a Wildfire Spark awakened within. The heir escaped into exile, guided by a animal spirit of ash and embers.

Now, they seek power  political, magical, and financial to **rebuild the Court**. They view fire as **a gardener’s tool**: pruning the world of corruption so strength can flourish.

**How They Get Along in a Party:**

- Charming, well-spoken, and pragmatic
- Will protect allies if they prove useful
- Sees the adventuring guild as a stepping-stone to influence

**Roleplay Hooks:**

- Collects names of nobles and politicians with… combustible secrets.
- Might occasionally test allies’ loyalty in uncomfortable ways.
- Keeps a scorched signet ring from their fallen house
