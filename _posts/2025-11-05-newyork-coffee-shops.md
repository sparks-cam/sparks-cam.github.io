My wife and I recently traveled to New York for a work trip. Whenever we can, we try to do these trips together. It’s nice to get out of our normal routine for a bit and have time that isn’t just work, chores, and parenting.

We usually have the grandparents watch our child and then work from a new city. My wife tends to work from an office or dedicated workspace, and I usually end up bouncing between coffee shops. That’s pretty much how this trip went too, except this time it was New York City.

## Coffee Shop Vibe and Momentum

New York doesn’t really treat coffee shops like a place you *go*. They feel more like part of the city’s infrastructure.

That was the first thing that stood out to me. People were constantly coming and going. Every time I felt like I needed a change of scenery, I’d see the same people leaving too and sometimes I’d run into them again later at another shop or a lunch spot nearby.

There’s a very obvious rhythm to it. People show up, work for a bit, move on. Each shop had its own pace, but everyone seemed to understand it without talking about it.

You can stay.  
Just don’t take up more space than you need.  
Be aware of what you’re doing.

Back home in the Midwest, going to a coffee shop usually feels like more of a plan. You decide to go, you sit down, and you stay for a while. In New York, it felt much more fluid. You stop in, you work, you leave. That alone changed how my workdays felt.

Working remotely from a New York coffee shop was oddly freeing. Everyone around you is busy, but no one is paying attention to you. People are writing, coding, studying, meeting, zoning out. No one cares how long you’ve been there or what’s on your screen.

The noise espresso machines, conversations, traffic blends together after a while. I actually found it easier to focus than I usually do in quieter Midwest coffee shops.

## Coffee Shops as Temporary Offices

Something else I noticed pretty quickly was how normal it felt to treat coffee shops like temporary offices. Laptops were everywhere. Headphones were basically standard.

In the Midwest, working from a coffee shop can sometimes feel like you’re overstaying your welcome. In New York, it felt expected. As long as you ordered something and weren’t being careless with space, no one seemed bothered. I only had one instance where someone was annoyed that I had sprawled out a bit more but they just grumbled to themselves and moved to the other side of the shop. I feel like if this was in the midwest, they'd probably talk to me directly or even complain to the staff.

It made remote work feel less lonely, even without interacting with anyone.

## Vegan Options in New York Coffee Shops

The difference in vegan options between New York and the Midwest is pretty noticeable.

Almost every place I went had multiple plant milk options. Oat milk felt like the default most of the time, but almond, soy, and even cashew milk showed up regularly too.

Food-wise, it wasn’t even a question. A lot of our trips end up turning into accidental vegan food tours just because it’s so easy to find good options. New York already has a reputation for that, and the coffee shops definitely live up to it.

Just on this trip, at coffee shops alone, I had vegan versions of:
- Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwiches  
- Scallion cream cheese bagels  
- A few different donuts  
- Multiple croissants  

None of it felt like a backup option. Vegan food wasn’t hidden or treated like a special case. It was just there on the normal menu next to the other "regular" food.

## Ordering Vegan Without Making It a Thing

One small but important detail: ordering vegan in New York didn’t feel like a conversation.

You order your drink.  
You order your food.  
That’s it.

No explaining. No clarifying. No surprised reactions. In the Midwest, even when vegan options exist, it can still feel like something you have to navigate. In New York, it felt completely normal and unremarkable  which honestly was refreshing. I think there was maybe one major time I had asked questions about what's vegan on the menu.  That was mainly because my wife ended up getting lied too about a Beyond Sausage, Egg and Cheese sandwich. They told her it was vegan (I'm assuming in a rush) on her way to the office and when I followed up an hour later they told me the only thing vegan was the sausage which meh is to be expected but that was probably the outlier when it came to ordering vegan food.

## The Coffee

I don’t think the best coffee in the Midwest is worse than the best coffee in New York. On the high end, specialty shops feel pretty similar in both places.

The difference is consistency.

In New York, the average coffee shop just seems slightly better on average. Not dramatically. Just more reliable. And because there are so many coffee shops close together, it’s easier to stumble into something good without trying very hard.

I’ve had coffee in the Midwest that made me double check the menu because the flavors were so clear it almost tasted like something had been added. I’ve had that same experience in New York too.

So overall, I’d say the coffee itself is pretty even. New York just makes it easier to find good coffee without searching for it.

## The Matcha

I’ve gone through more than a few “I’m only drinking tea now” phases, and matcha has always been part of that. So I pay a little more attention to it than I probably should.

Matcha feels like it’s only recently started showing up consistently in Midwest coffee shops, and even then the options are usually limited.

In New York, I kept seeing matcha drinks I’d never heard of:
- Banana Bread Matcha Latte  
- Strawberry Shortcake Matcha Latte  
- Blondie Matcha Latte  
- Blueberry Matcha Latte  

One place even had “Matcha Water” on the menu, which, as far as I can tell, is just matcha with hot water. Basically tea. But it was clearly being treated as its own thing.

There really isn’t much comparison here. New York just seems way further along when it comes to matcha, both in variety and how common it is to see people ordering it.

## Midwest Comfort vs. New York Pace

Midwest coffee shops tend to feel comfortable and familiar.
New York coffee shops feel more utilitarian.

One encourages you to settle in.
The other encourages you to keep moving.

Neither is better. They just support different ways of working. Spending time in New York made me realize how much my environment affects how I work and how my day feels overall.

Working from coffee shops in New York didn’t change what I do for work. It just changed how my days felt while doing it.

It made me realize I work better with a bit of movement, a bit of noise, and fewer expectations. And it also made me appreciate the slower, more comfortable coffee culture back home a little more too.

Mostly, it was just a good reminder that changing your surroundings, even temporarily, can shift your perspective more than you expect.
